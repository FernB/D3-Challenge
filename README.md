## Summary

When the [data visualisation page](https://fernb.github.io/D3-Challenge/) is loaded, the graph is intialised using the first axis selections.

On hovering over each data point the border of the point is highlighted and a tooltip containing the state, x and y data is revealed.

On selecting a different x or y axis label the dataset is changed to match the label name. The axes are rescaled accordingly.
